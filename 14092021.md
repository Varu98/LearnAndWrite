I havent completed two questions just because of the reason that I am being lazy and i am missing out on mock interviews becasue of the same.

Now after looking at a while I realise that my procrastination is uselessly tiring me out and making me decide rather against my benefit.

I found a couple f interesting resources though due to that same habit of procrastination. I will see when i will start practising on the same.

Dayum Ankur Sir called home, and this was a close one. I am still mad at this guys why would he always put efforst in making absolute crap happen to all the people here in the college.

Once more thing I think i am missing out a lot on my life just becuase i am failing to network. Shit i cant even upload this on Github due to this being a Markdown Language and our fav platform Github being Public.
